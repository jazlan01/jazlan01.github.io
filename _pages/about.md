Hi! I am a first year PhD student at the **University of California, Davis**. I am advised by [Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair//) and [Alexander Gamero-Garrido](https://www.gamero-garrido.com) in the Privacy and Networks domain. My work focuses on advanced anti-tracking frameworks.

Before this, I was an undergraduate student at LUMS, advised by [Zafar Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/) and [Ihsan Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com), working in the Cellular Systems domain.
