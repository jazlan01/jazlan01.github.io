<div style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 5px solid #52adc8; padding: 20px; margin: 30px 0;">
I am looking for a Summer 2026 research internship where I can tackle challenges in privacy, security, or browser technologies. I'm eager to contribute to meaningful projects and would be delighted to discuss any potential opportunities. Please reach out if you know of a suitable role.

Hi! I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of California, Davis. My advisors are [Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) and [Alexander Gamero-Garrido](https://www.gamero-garrido.com/). I am also a part of [ProperData](https://properdata.eng.uci.edu/).

I completed my undergrad at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk/) in 2024 where I was advised by [Zafar Ayub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/) and [Ihsan Ayub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/). 


## Research Interests

I am interested in problems around privacy and security on the web. 

My current research involves conducting measurements on the web and developing systems for enhancing the privacy of users. Previously, I have worked on developing [anti-tracking technologies](/publication/2025-07-15-webllm-pets-2025) for the browser with small LLMs.
